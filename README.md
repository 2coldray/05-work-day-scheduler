## Description

The WorkDay Scheduler is a calendar application where user's can organize and keep track of their day by logging their daily activities. The app displays the current date, and has time blocks from 9AM to 5PM. If the user would like to log activities, they can type them in the textbox provided and click the save button. The activity will be displayed in the box and will stay there even if the page is refreshed. The boxes will change color based upon the time in the day. Gray boxes signify the past, a red box signifies the present, green boxes signifies the future. 

## Installation

## Credits

I used the moment.js documentation for time formatting: https://momentjs.com/docs/ . I also talked through hard coding the local storage, and assigning the past, present, and future classes to the textarea boxes on discord in a study group.
